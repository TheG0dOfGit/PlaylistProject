The Playlist object contains a collection of Song objects, which each has a title, artist, duration, and "like" status.
The Playlist allows for the following: Adding a song, "liking" a song, removing a song, displaying all songs, displaying a sublist of "liked" songs, determining the total playtime of the playlist, deleting "unliked" songs from the playlist.
